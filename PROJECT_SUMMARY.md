# Weekly Meal Planning Agent - Project Summary

## Overview

A production-ready durable execution agent built with Prefect that generates personalized weekly meal plans using Claude AI, with Slack-based human approval workflows and automated Todoist grocery list creation.

## Key Features

✅ **Natural Language Preferences** - Describe dietary needs in plain English
✅ **AI Meal Generation** - Claude generates 2 quick meals (<20 min) tailored to your needs
✅ **Human-in-the-Loop Approval** - Slack thread-based approval with feedback loop
✅ **Durable Execution** - Prefect pause/resume with 24-hour approval timeout
✅ **Security-First Design** - Strict validation ensures ONLY Grocery project access
✅ **Full Observability** - Logfire integration for tracing, metrics, and audit logs
✅ **Production Ready** - Comprehensive tests, error handling, and documentation

## Architecture Highlights

### Prefect Pause/Resume Pattern

```python
# Flow pauses and waits for input
approval_input = pause_flow_run(
    wait_for_input=ApprovalInput,  # RunInput subclass
    timeout=86400,  # 24 hours
)

# Flow state stored in Prefect Cloud (no external storage needed!)
# Slack bot monitors thread, user responds
# Bot calls Prefect API to resume flow with ApprovalInput
# Flow resumes here with approval_input
```

**Key insight**: Prefect's `pause_flow_run()` with `wait_for_input` handles all state persistence automatically. No need for external databases or storage!

### Security Design

Every Todoist task creation goes through validation:

```python
def validate_project_id(project_id: str) -> None:
    """CRITICAL security check."""
    if project_id != config.todoist_grocery_project_id:
        logfire.error("SECURITY INCIDENT", security_incident=True)
        raise ProjectAccessDenied("Only Grocery project allowed")
```

- ✅ Pre-call validation on EVERY task creation
- ✅ Hard fail (no fallbacks or retries with different IDs)
- ✅ Audit logging to Logfire with security flags
- ✅ Unit tests verify security controls

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Natural Language Preference Parsing

Instead of structured config files, users provide preferences in natural English:

```
"I'm vegetarian, no mushrooms. I like Mediterranean and Asian flavors."
```

Claude parses this into structured format:
```json
{
  "dietary_restrictions": ["vegetarian"],
  "cuisines": ["Mediterranean", "Asian"],
  "avoid_ingredients": ["mushrooms"],
  ...
}
```

### 2. Slack Approval with Prefect Resume

Flow posts to Slack, then pauses:
```python
message_ts = await post_meal_plan_to_slack(meal_plan)

# Flow pauses here, state stored in Prefect Cloud
approval_input = pause_flow_run(wait_for_input=ApprovalInput, timeout=86400)

# User responds in Slack thread
# Slack bot calls: POST /flow_runs/{id}/resume with ApprovalInput
# Flow resumes here with user's decision
```

### 3. Feedback Loop with Regeneration

If user provides feedback:
```python
if approval_input.regenerate and approval_input.feedback:
    # Regenerate meals with feedback
    meal_plan = await generate_meal_plan(preferences, feedback=approval_input.feedback)
    # Post new plan and pause again
```

Maximum regeneration attempts: 3 (configurable)

### 4. Todoist MCP Integration

All task creation goes through security validation:

```python
async def create_todoist_task(task: TodoistTask) -> dict:
    # CRITICAL: Validate before ANY MCP call
    validate_and_audit_task_creation(
        project_id=task.project_id,
        task_content=task.content,
    )

    # Only reaches here if validation passes
    result = await mcp_client.create_task(...)
    return result
```

Tasks formatted as:
```
[Meal Name] Ingredient - Quantity Unit (shopping notes)
Labels: grocery, meal-prep, this-week
Due: tomorrow
```

### 5. Logfire Observability

Automatic instrumentation:
```python
logfire.configure()
logfire.instrument_anthropic()  # Auto-trace Claude API calls

@logfire.instrument("parse_preferences")
async def parse_dietary_preferences(...):
    # All operations automatically traced
```

Tracked metrics:
- Claude API token usage and latency
- Approval wait time (pause → resume)
- Regeneration count per flow
- Security validation attempts
- Error rates and retry attempts

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Model validation (Pydantic schemas)
- Security controls (project ID validation)
- Slack response parsing
- Configuration loading

### Integration Tests
- Mocked Claude API responses
- Mocked MCP server responses
- Mocked Slack API calls
- End-to-end flow simulation

### Manual Tests
- Configuration verification
- Component-level testing
- Real API integration (optional)

Run tests:
```bash
make test          # All tests
make test-unit     # Unit tests only
make test-manual   # Manual interactive tests
make test-cov      # With coverage report
```

## Configuration Management

Environment variables managed through:
1. `.env` file (local development)
2. Prefect variables (cloud deployment)
3. Pydantic validation (type safety + format checks)

Example validation:
```python
@field_validator("anthropic_api_key")
def validate_anthropic_key(cls, v: str) -> str:
    if not v.startswith("sk-ant-"):
        raise ValueError("Invalid Anthropic API key format")
    return v
```

## Deployment

### Local Testing
```bash
python manual_test.py      # Test individual components
python -m src.main         # Run full flow locally
```

### Prefect Cloud Deployment
```bash
prefect cloud login
prefect work-pool create managed-execution --type managed
prefect deploy -f deployment/prefect_deployment.yaml
```

Schedule: **Every Saturday at 5pm UTC**

### Environment Variables (Prefect Cloud)
```bash
prefect variable set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY "sk-ant-..."
prefect variable set SLACK_BOT_TOKEN "xoxb-..."
# ... (all other variables)
```

## Security Considerations

### Project Access Control
- **Single Project Only**: Agent can ONLY write to configured Grocery project
- **Pre-call Validation**: Every task creation validates project ID first
- **No Fallbacks**: Hard fail if validation fails (no retries with different IDs)
- **Audit Trail**: All access attempts logged to Logfire with security flags

### API Key Management
- Keys stored in environment variables (never committed to git)
- Pydantic validation ensures correct formats
- Prefect Cloud variables for production deployment

### Error Handling
- Retry logic on transient failures (API rate limits, network errors)
- Security failures (wrong project) never retried
- Graceful degradation (timeouts use last generated plan)

## Performance Characteristics

### API Latency
- Preference parsing: ~2-5 seconds (Claude API)
- Meal generation: ~5-10 seconds (Claude API)
- Task creation: ~1-2 seconds per task (MCP server)

### Approval Timeout
- Default: 24 hours
- Flow continues waiting (durable execution)
- No infrastructure costs during pause (Managed Execution)

### Regeneration
- Max attempts: 3 (configurable)
- Each regeneration: ~10-15 seconds total

## Observability

### Logfire Dashboard
- **Traces**: Full execution timeline with spans
- **Metrics**: API latency, approval wait time, regeneration count
- **Logs**: Structured logs with context
- **Errors**: Automatic error tracking and alerting
- **Security**: Audit trail of all project access attempts

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Approval response time (target: <1 hour)
- Regeneration rate (target: <30%)
- Security incidents (target: 0)
- API error rate (target: <1%)
- Flow success rate (target: >95%)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- [ ] Multi-week meal planning
- [ ] Ingredient inventory tracking
- [ ] Nutrition information
- [ ] Cost estimation
- [ ] Recipe photo generation (Claude vision)
- [ ] Multiple approval channels (email, SMS)
- [ ] Meal plan templates
- [ ] Family preferences (different dietary needs)

### Architecture Extensions
- [ ] Webhook-based Slack integration (faster than polling)
- [ ] Multiple Todoist projects (with strict access controls)
- [ ] Recipe storage (database for favorites)
- [ ] Meal history and recommendations

## Lessons Learned

### ✅ What Worked Well
- **Prefect pause/resume**: Perfect for human approval workflows
- **Natural language preferences**: More user-friendly than structured config

- **MCP integration**: Clean abstraction for external services

### 🔄 What Could Be Improved
- Slack polling could be replaced with webhooks (faster response)
- MCP server should validate project ID server-side (defense in depth)
- Could add caching for repeated preference parsing
- Meal plan history would enable better recommendations
